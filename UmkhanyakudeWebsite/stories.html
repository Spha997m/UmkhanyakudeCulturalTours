    <h2>The Legacy of King Shaka Zulu</h2>
    <p>
      King Shaka kaSenzangakhona, also known as Shaka Zulu, was one of the greatest African military leaders in history. 
      He united the Zulu people in the early 19th century and established a powerful Zulu kingdom in southern Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaka revolutionized warfare with new tactics and formations, including the famous "bull horn" formation, and introduced the short stabbing spear (iklwa). 
      Under his leadership, the Zulu nation grew into a disciplined and feared force across the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      His legacy lives on not just through history, but also in the spirit, pride, and unity of the Zulu people today. 
      At Umkhanyakude Cultural Tours, we honor his legacy by sharing these stories with visitors from around the world.
